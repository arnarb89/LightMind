This is a Java application I started as a school project but I worked at it all following summer. It is a mindmap creation software with a lot of features.

Create, move og delete bubbles. Can apply operations on many bubbles at once where applies.

Undo/redo system. Keyboard shortcuts for many operations.

Pan and zoom using AffineTransform. Export mindmap as image.

Ability to freehand draw with different colors on a bubble. The drawing is attached to the bubble and if the bubble and the drawing follows the bubbles movement. Can remove the drawing.

Insert images into bubbles from file, url or clipboard. Can resize images and remove them. Images Base64 encoded and are saved inside the mindmap file.

Click on a bubbles text to open in-bubble text editor with shift-enter newline functionality. Bubbles autoresize to wrap text and images.

Connect bubbles with curved lines that move with the bubbles. Can remove connections.

Save to/load from file, custom fileformat and ‘Recent Files’ in ‘Menu’.  

Option for ‘smart-select’ system (selects the bubble closest to your click) as well as normal shift/ctrl selection functionality to select/deselect bubbles. Selected bubbles are highlighted.

Select different colors and shapes (rectangle, rounded rectangle, oval, cloud, note) for bubbles.
